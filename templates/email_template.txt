Hi,

I hope you are doing well. 
 
I'm Elly Kruse, a UW-Madison student working with two colleagues on an inventory optimization system. Our co-founder, Sumanth Karnati, implemented this solution at an automotive company, where it saved $7 million (4%) in spare parts costs within a year.
 
Given your experience managing inventory at {business_name}, I'd value your perspective on:
 
- What inventory challenges impact your operations most?
- How could an optimization system better serve businesses like yours?
 
While our core algorithm is fully developed, we're refining integration processes for different business systems. Your insights would be incredibly helpful, even if just through a brief 15-minute conversation.
 
Would you be open to sharing your expertise with us?
 
Thanks for considering,
Elly Kruse
